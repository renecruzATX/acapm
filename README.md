## Let's create our own package manager

*- Create a node program
*- Check for the first process argument to be init
*- If the first argument is init continue processing else end the program
*- check if a file named package.json already exists, if it does exit the program
*- Use readline to ask for 5 inputs
*- Create a string that is a json object
*- The key values should be the inputs you get from the user
*- Save this json to a file called package.json

# Bonus
*- Don't hardcode 5 readlines
*- Don't using string concatenation or template literals
